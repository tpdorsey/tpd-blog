title: Web Page Size, Speed, and Performance Book For O'Reilly

tags: programming, web
summary: I wrote a book about web development, site performance, and why faster is better.


**Note: O'Reilly is no longer promoting the book, so I've posted a copy of [Web Page Size, Speed, and Performance]({static}/files/webpage-size-speed-perf.pdf) on my site if you're interested.**

Head over to [HTTP Archive](http://httparchive.org/trends.php) and check out their trends graphs. Notice anything? That's right, web pages keep getting bigger and more complicated. The problem here is that &mdash; particularly in e-commmerce &mdash; consumers of your site expect it to load and become interactive quickly.

Turns out, the problems involved and solutions needed to fix them depend, mostly, on straightforward, Web Dev 101-level knowledge and technology. I recently wrote a short e-book on the subject for O'Reilly, [Web Page Size, Speed, and Performance](https://web.archive.org/web/20200414161528/https://www.oreilly.com/webops-perf/free/webpage-size-speed-perf.csp) (free, registration required).

There's also an accompanying blog post on O'Reilly Radar, [It's time for a web page diet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121182450/http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/06/web-page-diet-grow-business.html).

> Slimming down web sites is not necessarily a matter of learning new and sophisticated programming techniques. Rather, getting back to basics and focusing on correct implementation of web development essentials &mdash; HTML, CSS and JavaScript &mdash; may be all it takes to make sure your own web sites are slim, speedy and responsive.

Interesting side note: mobile web users (and probably app users as well) expect *faster* interaction than on the desktop and are *more* likely to ditch an action if it's slow. Think about the implications of that complication on your app development plans.
