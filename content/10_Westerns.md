summary: I have opinions about western movies.


Because all the cool kids are doing it, here's my list of great Westerns:

* High Noon
* Little Big Man
* The Outlaw Josie Wales
* The Long Riders
* Unforgiven
* Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
* The Searchers
* Bad Day at Black Rock
* Bronco Billy
* Jeremiah Johnson

Apparently I like movies about loners. Not terribly surprising.

I also now have a great, new list of movies to check out thanks to the top-ten lists from [Jim Coudal](http://coudal.com/archives/2011/07/my_list_of_west.php), [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/20/top-ten-westerns) and [Gary Hustwit](http://urbanizedfilm.com/blog/10-westerns-i-like/).
