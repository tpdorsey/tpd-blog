summary: Photos of the internals of a Magnavox CDB-460 CD Player.

The Magnavox CDB-460 is a mid-level single-disk CD player from the late 1980s. Manufactured by Philips in Belgium and sold under the Magnavox brand in the US, these CD players were often overlooked, but quite well designed and capable of excellent performance. 

The CDB-460 features the venerable Philips TDA1541 DAC and CDM-2/10 swing arm transport. 

This one was non-operative when acquired. It has since been restored: replacing old electrolytic capacitors, cleaning, regreasing, and replacing the drive band on the CD tray mechanism, and socketing upgraded output op amps. Sounds pretty great.
