summary: At VT Code Camp 5 in September, I had chance to appear as a guest on David Giard's Technology and Friends.


At VT Code Camp 5 in September, I had a chance to sit down with [David Giard](http://www.davidgiard.com/) and talk through some of the issues raised in my Writing About Code session and some general tips for writers.

David posted [Episode 287: Terrence Dorsey on Writing About Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PoBp6vbo8w) today. I hope you find it interesting.
