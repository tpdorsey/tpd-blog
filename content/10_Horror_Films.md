summary: I have opinions about horror movies.


Back in 2011, I pulled together a list of [10 Great Westerns]({filename}/10_Westerns.md) that I'd recommend watching. In honor of Halloween 2013, here's a selection of "horror" films I think stand the test of time.

* The Shining
* 28 Days Later
* Halloween
* Alien
* Evil Dead 2
* Jaws
* The Sixth Sense
* Invasion of the Body Snatchers
* Zombieland
* No Country for Old Men

Special shout out for "Carrie" in recognition of Sissy Spacek's incredible performance, though I don't think the movie stands up all that well as a horror film.

Trivia: During my freshman year at UCLA, some friends and I attended what I believed to be the first public showing of an almost-complete "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn" at the film school. Sam Raimi introduced the film, gave us some background about "The Evil Dead" and his efforts to remake it properly, and then... our minds were blown.

Maybe I'm remembering it wrong. There's nothing I can find on the interwebs referencing this event, so if anyone out there remembers this and can confirm, deny or clarify my memories, please get in touch.

Happy Halloween!
