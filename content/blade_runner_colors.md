There's still a lot of controversy about whether Deckard is a replicant in the movie _Blade Runner_. You can interpret the film as you like, but I think costume design conveys a lot about what the original production team thought about the characters. 

For this post, I won't be getting into the history of "Deckard is a replicant" except to say that's never been my interpretation of any version of the film, and Deckard is _not_ a an android in the Philip K. Dick novel from which _Blade Runner_ was adapted.

What I'd like to lay out here is some evidence from the _Blade Runner_ production design that appears to clearly delineate who is human and who is replicant. Or, more specifically, to delineate the "human-ness" of a character within a given scene.

The evidence I want to lay out here indicates that costuming within the film signifies where a character exists on a spectrum of human-versus-replicant. Human characters have been given costumes rich with color and texture. Replicants are costumed in shades of black, white, and gray. It's no more complex than that, and shifts in costuming seems intentionally used to indicate that the human-ness of some characters shifts along with certain points in the narrative.

Let's get to some examples. We'll move more or less along with the story since that approach best shows how some twists in the story are paralleled by changes in costuming.

We first meet Blade Runner Holden (in a beige or tan suit) giving the Voight-Kampff test to Leon (wearing all white).

Brown, earthy colors are quickly associated with cops here &mdash; humans who do dirty work.

Deckard (eating) is wearing a brown overcoat, though with an indigo shirt peeking out. Bryant is wearing shades of beige and brown. 

Gaff, like the others, wears a brown coat, but underneath: blue, pink, yellow/gold &mdash; intricate patterns, a rose on his lapel. Maybe the most vibrant palette of any character in the film. Is Gaff the most human, the most internally vibrant? He "knows" things, or intuits them, and leaves clues. 

I suspect Gaff represents a chorus of sorts, commenting aside on what the actors on stage won't say. (And coincidentally, Gaff is a man of few words, but words that say volumes when he does speak.)

Leon (Tyrrell) - Pale blue or white - company uniform (looks white when he shoots Holden)
Holden - Beige
Deckard (eating) - Brown, Indigo
Gaff - Brown coat, but underneath: Blue, Pink, Yellow/Gold - Intricate patterns, rose on lapel. Maybe the most vibrant palette. Is Gaff the most human, most centered/connected? He "knows"
Bryant - Beige, Brown
Tyrrell - Purple/Indigo
Rachael - Black - Red lips!
Deckard (Tyrrell) - Brown, Blue, Red, Yellow - Intricate pattern, many colors!
Gaff (Leon's room) - Pink, Red
Roy - Black, White
Leon - Black
Hannibal Chew - Brown, Gray, Yellow - Very muted colors in this scene
Rachael (Deckard's Apt) - Black
Pris - Black, Silver, Gray, White - Pink makeup
Sebastian - Brown, Red, Yellow
Abdul Ben Hassan - Red, White
Rachael (Phone) - White? - Could be pink, which doesn't fit
Taffey Lewis - Green, Blue, Red
Zhora (Salome) - Silver
Zhora - Black, Clear, Silver/Gray sparkles
Deckard (Taffey's Bar) - Burgundy, Red, Yellow, Seagreen, Blue - Firebird pattern!
Rachael (Street) - White, Gray
Rachael (Deckard's Apt) - Grayscale
Pris (Sebastian's Apt) - Black, White
Roy - Black, Gray
Sebastian - White, Gray, Black - See note 1 below
Tyrrell (Tyrrell's Room) - Pure White - See note 2 below
Sebastian - Brown, Red - Human again, appalled by Roy.

Note 1: when Sebastian is with Roy and Pris ("We've got a lot in common"...) and reveals that his Methuselah Syndrome makes him unable to work off-world -- less than fully human -- he's removed his colorful jacket and is now wearing a white, gray, and black striped sweater.

Note 2: This costuming choice seems to diverge from the rest, probably in service of the specific scene. It also connects back to the first scene in which Leon appears to be wearing all white, and possibly with the white dove in Roy's final scene.
