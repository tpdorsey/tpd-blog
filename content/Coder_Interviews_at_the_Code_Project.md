I've been working with software developers for a long time now, and one thing I learned along the way is that coders are a diverse bunch. That's one reason why it has been fun and entertaining to launch our [A Coder Interview With...](http://www.codeproject.com/kb/interviews/) series of interviews at the Code Project. We started the series in August 2011 and have been posting a new interview more or less weekly since then.

The big idea behind these interviews is share the stories of working developers who are actively involved in larger coding community â€” whether that's the Code Project in particular, open-source projects, or just folks who actively share their knowledge and enthusiasm about programming.

I'd like to acknowledge that [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) provided much inspiration for this project. I really enjoy the consistent, concise format of these interviews. For Code Project we chose to use a similar set question format, but expand the topic to discuss topics like languages and frameworks of interest, how they learned to program, what advice they'd give to up-and-coming programmers and what they really despise in a codebase.

I heartily recommend reading through these interviews to get a good idea of what tools and techniques working developers are actively using today and the new technologies they're embracing for tomorrow.

By the way, here are some of our most popular interviews so far:

[Chris Maunder](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/267615/A-Coder-Interview-With-Chris-Maunder), co-founder of The Code Project.

[Dave Ward](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/327251/A-Coder-Interview-With-Dave-Ward), better known to many of his readers and followers as Encosia.

[Sacha Barber](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/246323/A-Coder-Interview-With-Sacha-Barber), one of The Code Project's most famous and most prolific members.

[John D. Cook](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/338151/A-Coder-Interview-With-John-D-Cook) of the fascinating blog, The Endeavour.

[Phil Haack](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/300175/A-Coder-Interview-With-Phil-Haack), former ASP.NET team member, now a Githubber.

There are many other interesting interviews, and we keep adding more. For a taste of the fascinating folks we talk to check out:

[Iris Classon](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/449553/A-Coder-Interview-With-Iris-Classon), whose 18-month journey from newbie to pro-coder is a true inspiration.

[Khaled S. Ali](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/466259/A-Coder-Interview-With-Khaled-S-Ali), an actual rocket scientist: he writes the code that controls the Mars rovers.

More are on the way. Stay tuned. <a href="hhttp://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/BlogFeedList.aspx?amid=tpdorsey" rel="tag" style="display:none">CodeProject</a>
