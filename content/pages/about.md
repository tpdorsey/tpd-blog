## Writing Portfolio

Some examples of my writing:

["CSS Basics: The Box Model, Margin, and Padding"](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/227840/CSS-Basics-The-Box-Model-Margin-and-Padding), a CSS3 tutorial.

["Teaching Programming with Human Functions"]({filename}/Teaching_Programming_with_Human_Functions.md), a blog post I wrote about my experience creating curriculum for and teaching programming to 4th grade students. 

["Writing About Code: Structure"]({filename}/Writing_About_Code_Structure.md), an article based on a [Vermont Code Camp](https://www.vtcodecamp.org) presentation on writing techniques for technical authors. This is an approach to technical writing I still use today.

[TapUtils](https://github.com/tpdorsey/tap-utils) is a set of command line utilities I wrote as a companion piece to an iOS application for capturing craft beer ratings. The app is gone now, but I took documenting the apps as seriously as I would any other project in the readme file. 

[Web Page Size, Speed, and Performance]({filename}/My_Web_Perf_Book_For_OReilly.md), a book published by Oâ€™Reilly.

I also contributed to the Visual Studio Magazine "Toolbox" column for many years. Here are a few columns that were more "how-to" style content.

* ["How To Simplify the Dreaded Task of Documentation Publishing with GitHub Pages"](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2015/03/01/github-pages.aspx), an introduction to the tools I used to build and publish internal documentation using Markdown and GitHub at ESPN. 
* ["Automate All the Things: An AutoHotKey Primer for Developers"](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2015/06/01/autohotkey-primer.aspx)
* ["Bash on Windows: Getting Productive with Windows Subsystem for Linux"](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/07/21/bash-on-windows-linux.aspx)
